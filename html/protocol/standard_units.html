<h2 id="bitcoin">Bitcoin</h2>
<p><strong>Bitcoin</strong>, or <em>BTC</em> is the standard term for one hundred million Satoshis, and is the most common unit reference. Referring to coin values should be done in lower case, for example <em>ten bitcoins</em>.</p>
<p>This is the standard unit used in the Bitcoin Core reference client.</p>
<h2 id="microbitcoin">Microbitcoin</h2>
<p><strong>Microbitcoin</strong>, or <em>bit</em> or <em>μBTC</em> is a term for a one hundred Satoshis, meaning one million bits equal one bitcoin. The justification for this term is to avoid the use of fractional units for ease of use reasons.</p>
<h2 id="millibit">Millibit</h2>
<p>A <strong>millibit</strong>, or <em>mBTC</em> is a term for a hundred thousand Satoshis, so one thousand millibits equals one Bitcoin. The name originates from a BitcoinTalk web poll conducted in May of 2011. The term also extends to <em>millie</em>, and <em>millibitcoin</em></p>
<p>Support for this unit is the second most widespread, after BTC, and it is included as an option in the Bitcoin Core reference client.</p>
<h2 id="satoshi">Satoshi</h2>
<p>A <strong>Satoshi</strong>, or <em>sat.</em> is the smallest representable unit of Bitcoin that can be expressed in a Blockchain transaction. The name was bestowed in honor of Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, he did not reference or create the unit himself. The idea is credited to a forum poster in <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3311.msg46648#msg46648">February of 2011</a> discussing potential names for smaller units.</p>
<p>A single bitcoin unit represents one hundred million fractional Satoshi units. The unit of measurement is generally considered impractically small, so support for it within user interfaces is extremely limited.</p>
<p>Drawing inspiration from the Japanese name of Satoshi Nakamoto, Japanese characters have been suggested as representing a Satoshi: ㋛, サ, シ, し</p>
