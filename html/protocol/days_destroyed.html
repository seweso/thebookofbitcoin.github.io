<p>Bitcoin <strong>Days Destroyed</strong> or BDD, is a metric that refers to the time since the last movement of coins.</p>
<p>The metric is derived by determining the number of coins in a transaction multiplied by the number of days since the transaction was included in a block.</p>
<p>In theory this metric could be a mild threat to fungibility. For example, when Bitcoin miners prioritize transactions by their BDD, they treat some coins preferential treatment, therefore those coins are more valuable.</p>
<p>The metric is also widely used as a currency-wide indicator to indicate if long time holders are moving their cons.</p>
