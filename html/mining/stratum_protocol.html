<p>The <strong>Stratum</strong> protocol is an open source standard protocol for a server and client relationship between a full node and a light client to synchronize Blockchain data. The protocol, which originated in Electrum, to service Electrum clients from Electrum servers was built upon by Slush in <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/?topic=55842">December of 2011</a> to coordinate mining for his mining pool. Although the protocol is in quite common use, it is not a BIP standard, its development was done out of band with the common Bitcoin effort.</p>
<p>Slush popularized and <a href="https://slushpool.com/help/#!/manual/stratum-protocol">documented the protocol</a> in 2012, as a full replacement for the dated <em>getwork</em> method. Unlike the less popular <em>getblocktemplate</em> and <em>P2Pool</em> pooled mining solutions, Stratum avoids the use of a validating full node, lightening resource requirements but also harming decentralization.</p>
