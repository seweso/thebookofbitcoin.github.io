<p><strong>Block explorers</strong> provide a service to navigate and query the Blockchain and a set of unconfirmed transactions. Users find value in these web Applications for a variety of purposes: querying transactions associated with an address, checking third party perspectives on the state of the Blockchain, researching overall network statistics, inspecting the composition of the unconfirmed transactions that the explorer contains in its mempool, looking up block metadata such as block versions.</p>
<h2 id="blockr">blockr</h2>
<p>The <strong>blockr</strong> Blockchain explorer is an explorer that offers API access and a mode switch capability to explore the Bitcoin testnet.</p>
